# Machine problems

Students will work on four machine problems, each introducing a different type of medical data. Using Python, you will implement and evaluate machine learning algorithms discussed in class.

<ul>
  <li>MP1 – Classification of RNAseq gene expression data.</li>
  <li>MP2 – Unsupervised analysis of brain electrophysiological signals.</li>
  <li>MP3 – Deep learning for medical image classification.</li>
  <li>MP4 – Using and fine-tuning a large language model to analyze electronic health records.</li>
</ul>
