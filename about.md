## Academic integrity

As this is an advanced graduate-level course, students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity. Discussion of ideas is allowed for machine problems and lecture scribing assignments, but the submitted work must be your own. For each problem, please do cite any resources that you have used to solve it. Use of generative AI content in assignments is not allowed. Cheating in this course will result in a failing grade (F), and the University's policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
 

## Students with disability

Students requiring accommodations are encouraged to discuss their needs with the instructor at the beginning of the semester or as soon as possible. The course staff is committed to ensuring an inclusive and accessible learning environment for all students.

## Textbooks

There are no recommended textbooks for the class. However few topics will be borrowed from

<ul>
    <li> The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman.</li>
    <li> Deep learning. Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville.</li>
    <li> Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts. Christopher Bishop and Hugh Bishop.</li>
</ul>
