## Introduction

The course requires students to complete a semester-long group project focused on healthcare and AI. The project is a significant component of the course evaluation and consists of several deliverables: Project proposal, Midterm report, Poster presentation, and Final report.

Forming groups is mandatory. Students may form their own groups. However, if you need help, the instructor will facilitate a survey to understand your interests and share the results so that it will be easier for you to find potential group members. **For all project deliverables, one submission per group is sufficient** 

## Public healthcare datasets

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSlLnt318xdyVZ4c2RTAItvBvmpQwkCuENh0SkGzD8I/edit) is a list of publicly available health-related datasets of different types (e.g., imaging, signals, omics, EHR, wearables).  **Some of these might require additional approvals**, which is usually the case with healthcare data, so please make sure to look into how soon you can get access before deciding to do a project on these datasets. Also, do not feel obligated to use a dataset listed here, you can always chosse other datasets you find or have access to.


## Project proposal 
The project proposal accounts for 10% of the final project grade. By the proposal deadline, students should have gained access to their data and demonstrate an in-depth understanding of their dataset. They must also complete a literature review related to the project and establish clear (and achievable) project goals. [Here](https://z.umn.edu/ml4h_project_proposal_template) is a template you can use to write your project proposals.

## Project mid report 
The mid-report constitutes 20% of the final project grade. Students must present preliminary results and show appropiate progress since the project proposal. A template for the mid-report is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFDiMMquKg6-svfs-tDUWPIeW7SNw2Sg0tt9KMfeetM/edit). You do not have to fill in some of the sections unless you want to make some changes to your original proposal.

## Poster presentation
Presentation of final projects is going to be done via a poster presentation which will constitute 30% of the final project grade. 
1. Please use [this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BjLnkmEeBLMDWiMWVbwjIQRmmoczuWCS/edit#slide=id.p2) template to design your posters. The template has information on what you need to include in the poster. You can modify the template as you see fit (as long as you describe all the requested information in some way). Please do not change font sizes or the final print size.
2. You will use the CSE-IT poster printing service (free of charge) to print the poster. Please submit the print job using [this](https://tdx.umn.edu/TDClient/31/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=eEBbAJFCJqw_&RequestorType=Service) request form at least two business days ahead of the day of presentation. Mention CSENG CS&E Administration (11108) as the department. 
3. The presentations will be evaluated based on a number of aspects, including your understanding of the clinical problem, whether the solution addresses the problem at hand, whether the evaluations are reasonable, whether the results support the expected outcomes, how the group worked together as a whole, and the clarity in poster design and presentation. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ruRTf9SO3S-ZnRKmg_b7MFKZbJwVoQNF-FOBtJxNnqM/edit) is the detailed rubric. Your posters and presentations will be evaluated by peers from the class and external graders.

 

## Final report and code
Final report accounts for 40% of the final project grade. It is recommended to create a git repo with your code and include a link in the report. Otherwise, you can also create a zip file including your report and code. Please follow this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q38N_rB7ki4oCeSSQ6khWJ2HPonrqKg8oAHUl14dDCI/edit) for your final report.
